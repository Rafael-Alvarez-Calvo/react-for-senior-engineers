# react-for-senior-engineers
A practical deep dive into building, scaling and maintaining high-quality design systems for software engineers.

# Welcome to the React for Senior Engineers Course!!

Knowledge of React is 100% required for this course.

I've been working with React.js for over 5 years now, and I am so excited to share with you the skills needed to thrive as a senior React Engineer.

Do you want to build and architect React Apps like Microsoft and Github Engineers? This course is for you!

We'll build our very own design system from scratch. This will give us the opportunity to cover senior topics such as:

- CSS Architecture for React applications
- Typescript and its advantages for frontend engineers
- Design systems and atomic design principles
- Npm package creation, management and publishing
- Continuous integration and deployment for the frontend engineer
- Unit component testing
- Visual regression testing
- Storybook and component libraries
- Component design patterns
- Mono-repository architecture patterns
- Accessibility and unit accessibility testing
